## Generic Model - Orbital

## LibreSim Abstract
> The orbit module provides means to model orbital/trajectory movement of an object in the solar system and includes the calculation of planet positions, perturbation effects on the orbit. It computes the position and velocity of the object, taking into account the forces applied. It also defines a number of generic coordinate systems, including one for each planet and a local one for the object (spacecraft) to be modelled.

## Core Tasks:
The following tasks were identified at the start of the project to be completed.

- [ ] Set up an environment that replicates space
- [ ] Create an object (spacecraft) withing space environment
- [ ] Create celestial body objects within space environment
- [ ] Create interactivity between spacecraft and celestial bodies
- [ ] Create disturbances (perturbations) that can interrupt interactivity

## Technical Aspects

For developing the code, below mentioned technologies were used.

## Reflections

During the first phase, 

During the second phase,

The major roadblock was ...

Overall, it was a fun journey. I would thank my mentors Artur, Juanlu, and my fellow gsocer Hrishit, for guiding me throughout the project. I enjoyed learning a whole bunch of new things and writing industry-level codes.
