# Google Summer of Code 2022
[Official accepted GSoC Proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/user/6606cb8463d2/proposal/gAAAAABjPB8CarKx_E3gdRiaXdZnZs3BfR-Xy7fgQUIE-hhGpv20E88L48UOn6ZJo8g0Onn4voiN5WsqkV1oRNzGbW3DWg8ZWdUnpDwR0iHtbqw1Bh_142Q=.pdf)

## Abstract
> The orbit module provides means to model orbital/trajectory movement of an object in the solar system and includes the calculation of planet positions, perturbation effects on the orbit. It computes the position and velocity of the object, taking into account the forces applied. It also defines a number of generic coordinate systems, including one for each planet and a local one for the object (spacecraft) to be modelled.

I am a final-year student pursuing a B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at Federal University of Technology Akure. I have a strong interest in space exploration and have recently been reacquanited with the thrills of programming. My university is currently taking part in the national strike action with the academic staff union of universities so I can currently work for as many hours daily as possible. If we were to resume abruptly the time constraint would be limited but I would be able to give a minimum of 20hrs weekly for the GSoC project. If I am selected, I shall work around 30 hours a week on the project - unless my university resumes as stated previously, though I am open to putting in more effort if the work requires.

## Generic Model - Orbital

### Introduction


### Technical Details
#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] Task 1: Set up an environment that replicates space
- [ ] Task 2: Create an object (spacecraft) withing space environment
- [ ] Task 3: Create celestial body objects within space environment
- [ ] Task 4: Create interactivity between spacecraft and celestial bodies
- [ ] Task 5: Create disturbances (perturbations) that can interrupt interactivity


#### Proposed Solutions :



### Timeline
16 weeks (extended)
**Community Bonding Period (May 17 - June 6)**


*Official Coding Period (June 7 - August 23)*
**Week 1 (June 7 - June 13)**


**Week 2-3 (June 14 - June 27)**


**Week 4 -5 (June 28 - July 11)**


**Phase 1 evaluation period (July 12 - July 16)**


**Week 6-7 (July 17-25)**



**Week 8 ( July 26 - August 1)**


**Week 9-10-11(August 2 - August 23)**



### Deliverables
1. A functioning space environment
2. Ability for spacecraft object to be controlled by user
3. Proper documentation in the form of Pydocs and Blogs.
